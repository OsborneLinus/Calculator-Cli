# Calculator-Cli

### Want help to get this finished, we currently have an open source project in school to see how people communicate and integrate with eachother via github. 
Would appreciate your help and contribution, with the value for me (and maybe you) learning something new. 

An unfinished calculator made for a school project. Uses Tailwind and vanilla JS.


To get started:
clone the repo and make sure to cd to the correct folder

npm install 

npm run dev
